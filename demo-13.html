		AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers.

		The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

		A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.
	-->
	<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

	First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br>
	Last Name: <input type="text" ng-model="lastName"><br>
	<br>
	Full Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}}

	</div>

	<script>
	var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
	app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
	    $scope.firstName = "John";
	    $scope.lastName = "Doe";
	});
	</script>

	<!-- 
		Application explained:
		
		The AngularJS application is defined by  ng-app="myApp". The application runs inside the <div>.

		The ng-controller="myCtrl" attribute is an AngularJS directive. It defines a controller.

		The myCtrl function is a JavaScript function.

		AngularJS will invoke the controller with a $scope object.

		In AngularJS, $scope is the application object (the owner of application variables and functions).

		The controller creates two properties (variables) in the scope (firstName and lastName).

		The ng-model directives bind the input fields to the controller properties (firstName and lastName).
